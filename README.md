### Project Statement
This project was developed as a Social Network Exam submission. It explores how digital spaces can be built specifically for younger audiences by prioritizing mental health over "doom-scrolling" and safety over data mining.

### Project Purpose & Data Showcase
Important: This website is a technical demonstration. The live site is configured to:

Showcase Exam Data: Display the data structures and user flow collected during the exam research phase.

Demonstrate Logic: Show how the platform handles information and displays it to the user in a safe way.

Academic Proof: Serve as a visual evidence of the technical requirements met during the exam.

### Core Features
#### Safety First
The platform is designed to be a "walled garden," ensuring that interactions are simplified and monitored to protect children from inappropriate content.

#### Health & Well-being
Unlike traditional apps, PixiWorld focuses on children's health by:

Avoiding addictive feedback loops (like public like-counts).

Using a bright, positive color palette.

Implementing simple, non-stressful navigation.

### Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility.

CSS3: Custom styling for a child-friendly aesthetic.

JavaScript: Logic for data handling and interactivity.

GitHub Pages: Hosting for the live showcase.
